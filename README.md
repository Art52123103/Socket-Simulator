Socket-Simulator
================

 Objective 
 1) To use sockets for communication between machines, 2) to learn about performance metrics such as round-trip time (latency) and throughput in computer networks, 3) to measure the performance of TCP and UDP between pairs of networked computers, and 4) to simulate network protocols using sockets. 
 
 Description
 Sockets are inter-process communication mechanisms that allow processes to communicate with each other, even if they are on different machines.  In this project, you will use Internet Sockets to send different-sized messages among several machines and measure latency and throughput. You may also use Sockets to simulate CSMA/CD in a simple LAN setting.
